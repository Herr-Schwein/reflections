When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When multiple people work on the same project or same person works in different locations, etc.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Some branches are not ready to be public.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Branches are in one repository. Clones are copies from remote to local or local to local. Forks are copies from other's GitHub repository to your own.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
The origin/master branch records the latest ancestor of both local master and origin master. With this information, git can do the merge.
